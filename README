1) Install the NewPing.h library from the library manager
2) Install the Adafruit v1 motor shield library from the library manager.

Important: I'd suggest you use the analog pins as digital pins because the AFmotor shield is already using most of the digital PWM pins on 
the other side of the board. 
Thank you!
